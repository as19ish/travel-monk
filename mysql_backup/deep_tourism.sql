The mountain ranges cross two regions: Garhwal and Kumaon..\nThis range is also a part of Himalaya Sivalik Hills, the outer most hills of the Himalaya located in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.\n\nThe region consists almost entirely of rugged mountain ranges running in all directions and separated by narrow valleys, which in some cases become deep gorges or ravines. The only level portion of the district was a narrow strip of waterless forest between the southern slopes of the hills and the fertile plains of Rohilkhand. The highest mountains are in the eastern Chamoli district, the principal peaks being Nanda Devi 7,816 m (25,643 ft), Kamet 7,756 m (25,446 ft), Chaukhamba 7,138 m (23,419 ft), Trisul 7,120 m (23,360 ft), Dunagiri 7,066 m (23,182 ft), and Kedarnath 6,940 m (22,769 ft).\n\n\nThe Garhwal Himalayas appear to have been a favorite locale for the voluminous mythology of the Puranic period. The traditional name of Garhwal was Uttarakhand. Excavations have revealed that it formed part of the Mauryan Empire.citation needed\n\nThe earliest reference regarding Garhwal and its pride spots are cited in the Skanda Purana and the Mahabharata in the Van Parva. Skanda Purana defines the boundaries and extend of this holy land. It also finds mention in the 7th-century travelogue of Huen Tsang. However, it is with Adi Shankaracharya that the name of Garhwal will always be linked, for the great 8th-century spiritual reformer visited the remote, snow-laden heights of Garhwal, established a Joshimathand restored some of the most sacred shrines, including Badrinath and \nKedarnath.\n\nFamous Mountain Peaks in Uttarakhand\nNanda Devi East.

It is bounded on the north by Tibet, on the east by Nepal, on the south by the state of Uttar Pradesh, and on the west by the Garhwal region. The people of Kumaon are known as Kumaonis and speak the Kumaoni language.\n\nThe Kumaon Himalayas lie in Uttarakhand and extend from the Satluj to the Kali river.

The Nepal-Tibet border roughly follows the line of the highest part of the range (the Great Himalayas), featuring several of the world’s highest peaks: Everest (29,035 feet [8,850 metres]), Kanchenjunga (28,169 feet [8,586 metres]), Makalu (27,766 feet [8,463 metres]), Dhaulagiri I (26,795 feet [8,167 metres]), Manaslu I (26,781 feet [8,163 metres]), and Annapurna I (26,545 feet [8,091 metres]).

At a height of 2,439 m.,\n\nNandikund is a place where the people worship some rusty old historic swords thrust into the rocks. The local populace earnestly believe that the swords belonged originally to the Pandavas. The temple is surrounded by a number of pools - Surya Kund, Chandra Kund, Tara Kund, Manas Kund - while the great peaks of Nanda Devi, Trishul and Nanda Ghunti form a fabulous background.\n\n\nKalpnath\n\nThis small rock temple to be entered through a cave, 2km from Urgam and 11 km from Helang, bear the manifestation is of the Shiva\'s hair or Jata. The 14 km distance from Joshimath to Helang is motorable and the rest 11 km is a bridle path via Urgam, that begins with the crossing of the Alaknanda at Helang.\n\nMost of the trek is a gradual climb. Just 2 km before Kalpheshwar is the friendly village of Urgam (2334 m.) set amidst mesmerizing natural surroundings.\n','2020-05-15 07:53:33.919394'),(33,'Other','84','Char dham ','event_pics/IMG_20200517_103442.JPG',' Yamunotri','                   YAMUNOTRI DHAM\nYamunotri Dham ToursOn the western side of Garhwal Himalayas, in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, lies the holy place of Yamunotri. About 3,293 metres above the sea level, Yamunotri stands proudly with its enormous mountain peaks, glaciers and gushing waters of Yamuna. River Yamuna, the second most sacred river of India, originates in Yamunotri, making it one of the pilgrimage sites in the Chota Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand.\n\nThe venerated goddess Yamuna is said to be the daughter of Sun and twin sister of Yama (the god of death); in Vedas, Yamuna is called Yami (lady of life). A bath in the sanctified waters of Yamuna is said to cleanse all sins and protect from untimely or painful death. Such strong associations in Hindu mythology place Yamuna Devi (goddess) in high ranks of divinity\n\n\n\n ORIGIN OF THE YAMUNA RIVER & ASSOCIATED                     LEGENDS\nThe River Yamuna originates from the Yamunotri glacier, which rises up to 6,315 meters above sea level, and lies against a steep slope just below the top of the Kalind peak. From here Yamuna comes down into Saptarishi Kund and from there gushes southwards in a series of waterfalls. To the west of the Kalind Parbat is located Banderpoonch, which is a dominant mountain in central Himalayan area of Garhwal and divides the watershed of Yamuna from that of the Ganges. Coming out from Kalind Parbat, Yamuna is also known as Kalindi.\n\nAs per a legend, Lord Hanuman doused the fire of his tail after burning Ravan\'s Lanka in the chilly waters of Yamuna at Banderpooch. That is why the peak is called Bander (monkey) Pooch (tail) - monkey\'s tail. Another legend sees Yamunotri as the hermitage of ancient sage Asit Muni. The Muni used to bath both in Yamuna and Ganga, but in his old age he couldn\'t travel to Gangotri. Realising his problem, a stream of Ganga started to flow beside that of Yamuna.\n\n\n                   YAMUNOTRI TEMPLE\nThe holy abode of Goddess Yamuna is situated near the foot of Kalind Parbat (peak) and on a side of Banderpoonch Parbat. Nestled in the intimidating Himalayas, Yamunotri temple is believed to be constructed by the king of Tehri, Naresh Sudarshan Shah in 1839. One of the Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites, the stunning setting of the temple is enough to fill the hearts of the devotees with wonder. \nYamuna River jets down from one side of the temple, which houses Goddess Yamuna in the form of a black marble idol. Ganga Devi too finds her place, in white stone, by the side of Yamuna.\nThe temple of Yamuna closes its portals as winter approaches on Yama Dwitiya (second day after Diwali or on Bhai Dooj). Devi\'s winter address is Kharsali village where she reaches in a palanquin and will remain for the entire period of winters. On Akshaya Tritiya (occurring on April/May), the goddess comes back to grace Yamunotri again. Both closing and opening ceremonies of the Yamunotri shrine are brought about with celebrations, elaborate rituals and vedic chants.\n\n        SURYA KUND (THE POND OF THE SUN)\nVery near to the Yamuna Devi temple there are many hot water springs; the most significant among them is the Surya Kund. It holds the boiling-hot water as it emerges from the crevices in the mountain. People boil rice and potatoes by tying them in a cloth (preferably muslin cloth) and consider them a Prasad (religious offering) from Goddess Yamuna.\n\n        DIVYA SHILLA (THE DIVINE STONE)\nIt is a reddish-brown rock near the Surya Kund which needs to be worshipped before offering reverence to the main deity, Yamuna maa (mother). According to Skanda Purana, with a mere touch of the sacred rock one can attain spiritual liberation\n','event_pics/IMG_20200517_103638.JPG','gangotri','Gangotri Dham YatraGangotri Dham, located at the height of 3,100 meters (approx.) on the Himalayan range in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, holds a very special place in the hearts of Hindus. It is one of the four sacred and important pilgrimage sites of Chota Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand. Amid all the natural beauty and grace which the mountains and altitude of the place affords, what makes Gangotri one of the holiest places is its intimate connection with River Ganga (the Ganges).\n\n\n\nLEGEND BEHIND THE GANGOTRI\n\n           PENANCE OF BHAGIRATH\n\nGoing by the legends, it is said that King Sagara, the great grandfather of King Bhagirath slayed the demons on earth. In order to proclaim his supremacy, he decided to stage an Ashwamedha Yagna. During the yagna, a horse was supposed to be let loose to go on an uninterrupted journey across empires. In the course of events, Indra the supreme ruler feared that he might be deprived of his celestial throne if at all the yagna got complete. Using his celestial powers, he took away the horse and privately tied it in the ashram of Sage Kapila, who was seated in deep meditation.\n\nAs soon as King Sagara\'s agents realized that they had lost track of the horse, King allotted his 60,000 sons the task of tracing the horse. While the king\'s sons were on a hunt for the lost horse, they came across the spot where Sage Kapila was meditating. They found the horse tied next to him, out of fierce anger they stormed the ashram and accused the sage for stealing the hoarse. Sage Kapila\'s meditation got disrupted and out of fury he turned all the 60,000 sons into ashes just with his powerful glance. \nHe also cursed that their souls would attain Moksha, only if their ashes get washed by the holy waters of River Ganga, which was then a river, seated in heaven. It is said that Bhagirath, the grandson of King Sagara in order to free his ancestors performed rigorous penance for a 1000 long years to please Ganga to come down to the earth. Finally his efforts bore fruit and River Ganga was pleased by his devotion and was ready to descend to earth.\n\n\n              TALE OF RIVER GANGA\n\nAnother legendary tale states that when River Ganga agreed to descend to earth in response to Bhagirath\'s prayers, its intensity was such that the entire earth would have got submerged under its waters. To save the planet earth from such demolition, Lord Shiva caught River Ganga in his locks. To please Lord Shiva, Bhagirath again meditated for a very long time. On seeing Bhagirath\'s immense devotion, Lord Shiva being pleased released River Ganga in the form of three streams one of which came on earth and came to be known as the Bhagirathi River. As soon as Ganga\'s water touched the ashes of the Bhagirath\'s ancestors, the 60,000 sons rose from eternal rest. The stone on which Bhagirath is believed to have meditated is known as the Bhagirath Shila which is located fairly close to the Gangotri Temple.\n\n\nMYTHOLOGIES BEHIND THE BIRTH OF RIVER GANGA\nIt is said in one of the mythological tales that Ganga, was a vivacious beautiful woman who was born out of Lord Brahma\'s Kamandalu (water vessel). There are two accounts of her birth. One proclaims that Lord Brahma while washing Lord Vishnu\'s feet had collected this water in his Kamandalu after Lord Vishnu had freed the universe from demon Bali in his rebirth as Vaman.\n\nAnother legend states that Ganga came down to earth in the form of a human and married an ancestor of the Pandavs of the Mahabharat, King Shantanu. She is believed to have yielded seven sons who were thrown into the river by her and the reasons behind this are unexplained. Her eighth child, Bheeshma, was spared due to the intervention of King Shantanu. Ganga left him. Bheeshma is the one who later played a very crucial role throughout Mahabharata, the grand epic.\n\n   WHAT TO SEE IN GANGOTRI DHAM?\n\n                GANGOTRI TEMPLE\nA picture of serenity, the humble abode of Maa Ganga is situated by the side of Bhagirathi River. Located in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, the revered temple is one of the four pilgrimages in the Chota Char Dham circuit of Garhwal Himalayas. Mother Ganga is present in the premises of the white temple building in the form of a small silver idol. The amazing mountain range of Himalayas and the flowing Bhagirathi by the side makes for a perfect setting to behold the life-giving, gentle yet powerful deity. The pilgrims are required to bath in the crystal clear waters of the pious river before visiting the main shrine.\n\nAs the winter season gets ready to knock on the doors of the mountain region, Goddess Ganga gets ready to leave for Mukhyamath temple in Mukhba village, 20 km downstream. The transfer takes place on the auspicious day of Diwali (Oct/Nov) amid vedic chants and elaborate rituals. With greater joy and enthusiasm, the Goddess is brought back to the Gangotri temple on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya (April/May).\n\n            UNDERWATER SHIVLING\nA Shivling made from natural rock is submerged under water and is easily visible in winters when the water recedes. It is said to be the place Lord Shiva sat on while he tied Ganga in his matted hair. Dividing it into 7 streams, Shiva saved earth from the massive force of Devi Ganga.\n\n            GAUMUKH AND TAPOVAN\nTo witness the holy birth of River Ganges at Gaumukh, one can take up a picturesque and exciting trek surrounded with peaks and soaring peaks. One can further trek to Tapovan which is about 4 km from Gaumukh. Tapovan has meadows, beautiful flowers, streams and incredible views of surrounding Himalayan Peaks such as Shivling and Bhagirathi. Tapovan is also a base camp initiating a number of mountaineering tours.\n\n  BHAIRON NATH TEMPLE IN BHAIRON GHATI\n\nSome 10 km downstream from Gangotri, near the point where Jadh Ganga (also called Jhanvi River) merges with Bhagirathi, lies the temple of Bhairon Nath. As per a legend, Bhairon Nath was chosen by Lord Shiva as the protector of the region. And every visit to the Gangotri temple should be followed by a visit to the temple of Bhairon.\nMoving about 3 km from Bhairon Ghati one can reach Lanka Chatti to witness one of the highest river bridges of the region; the bridge over River Jhanvi is quite a spectacle in its own right.\n\n','event_pics/Kedarnath-Temple-Feature_kQg4FhY.jpg','kedarnath','Kedarnath Dham, located in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, is one of the most paramount locations for worshipers of Shiva. \n\nThe air appears to be reverberating with the name of Lord Shiva amid the mighty snow-clad peaks, enchanting meadows and forests of the lower mountain range of Himalayas. Situated in a breathtaking location, near the source of Mandakini River and at the height of 3,584 meters, Kedarnath Dham celebrates the greatness of Lord Shiva. \n\nKedarnath temple is one of the 12 Jyotir Lingams and is also the most important temple among the Panch Kedars (group of 5 Shiva temples in Garhwal Himalayas).\n\n\n\nLEGEND BEHIND THE KEDARNATH TEMPLE\n\nBurdened with the guilt of killing their blood relatives, Pandavas sought Lord Shiva to absolve themselves of their sins. Shiva didn\'t want to release them from their wrongdoings so easily and disguised himself as a bull to roam in Garhwal Himalayas. On being discovered by Pandavas, Shiva dived into the ground. Bhim tried to catch him and could only get hold of the hump. Other body parts of Shiva (in the form of bull), came up at different places. Hump of the bull was found in Kedarnath, navel emerged at Madhya-Maheshwar, two forelegs appeared at Tunganath, face in Rudranath, and hair came up at Kalpeshwar. Together these five sacred places are called Panch Kedar. It is believed that originally Pandavas built the temple of Kedarnath; the present temple was established by Adi Shankaracharya who restored and revived the glory of the shrine.\nChardham Yatra Uttarakhand\n\nWHAT TO SEE IN KEDARNATH DHAM?\n\n                   KEDARNATH TEMPLE\nThe grand and impressive structure of Lord Shiva\'s shrine is made of grey stone. Steep climb stretching to 14 km from Gauri Kund brims with abundant beauty of nature. The paved and steep path gifts the pilgrims the fantastic views of snowy-peaks, alpine meadows and delightful forests of rhododendrons. A large stone statue of Nandi Bull stares at the shrine, guarding it, sitting right opposite it.\n\nThere is one Garbha Griha which houses the primary idol (pyramid shaped rock) of Lord Shiva. The idols of Lord Krishna, Pandavas, Draupadi and Kunti find a space in the Mandapa section of the shrine. The temple has withstood natural calamities like avalanches, earthquakes and floods for over thousand years and still stands as strong and elegant as it must have originally been.\n\nWith the onset of winters, the portals of the temple are closed on the 1st day of Karthik (Oct/Nov) amid elaborate rituals, and a moveable idol of Shiva is shifted to Omkareshwar temple in Ukhimath (Rudraprayag district). The Shiva idol is welcomed back and the temple is opened again after 6 months in the Vaisakh (Apr/May) period of Hindu calendar.\n\n                          GAURIKUND\nIt is the starting point of the trek towards the temple of Kedarnath. As per a legend, Goddess Parvati (also known as Gauri) meditated over here in order to marry Lord Shiva. It consists of natural thermal springs and offer refreshing bath to pilgrims before they embark for the holy darshan of Kedareshwar (the Lord of Kedar, Shiva).\nThere is also an ancient Gauri Devi temple over here, honouring the goddess. Half Kilometre from Gauri Kund is the temple of Sirkata (headless) Ganesha. According to Skanda Purana, this was the place where Shiva beheaded Ganesha and then attached the head of an elephant on his headless body.\n\n                    CHORABARI GLACIER\nFed by Chorabari glacier, the serene and pristine Chorabari Lake can be reached after undertaking a trek of less than 4 km from the Kedarnath town. It is also known as Gandhi Sarovar as some of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed in its waters. On the way, there is a waterfall which one needs to cross. It looks amusing but care should be taken while going across it.\n\n                  BHAIRAV TEMPLE\nIn the temple complex, to the south side, there is another ancient and important temple. It is dedicated to Bhairav Nath, who is believed to be the one who guards the temple compound when the shrine is closed in the winter season.\n\n\n                       VASUKI TAL\nLocated at 3,135 meters, the crystal clear blue-water lake of Vasuki is about 8 km from Kedarnath. It is quite a difficult trek and involves going across glaciers, but the walk among the untouched Himalayas is worth every bit of effort.','event_pics/Badri_Night.JPG','badrinath','                         \n\nLEGEND BEHIND THE BADRINATH DHAM\n\n             BADRIKAASHRAM\n\nBadrinath being one of the most legendary Temples, it has numerous mythical tales associated with it. According to one mythological tale, Lord Vishnu had performed rigorous atonement at this place. During his intense meditation, he was unaware about the severe weather conditions. To protect him from the scorching heat of the sun, his spouse Goddess Lakshmi acquired the shape of Badri tree and spread over him. Witnessing this, Lord Vishnu was pleased by her devotion and hence he named the spot after her as Badrikashram.\n\n\n\nLORD NARAYANAS DESIRE TO MEDITATE IN BADRINATH\nAnother legend states that, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati were once performing tapasya in Badrinath. It was then Lord Vishnu came in disguise as a small boy and disrupted them, by crying loudly. On hearing that Goddesses Parvati asked him the reason behind his mournful behavior, to which he replied that he wanted to meditate in Badrinath. Shiva and Parvati, on discovering Lord Narayan in disguise, left Badrinath and moved to Kedarnath.\n\n\n          TALE OF NAR AND NARAYANA\n\nBadrinath Dham is also related to the tale of the two sons of Dharma, Nar and Narayana who wished to setup their hermitage and expand their religious base amidst the pious Himalayas. Going by the legends, during their quest to find a suitable place for their hermitage they led to a chanced discovery of the four sites of Panch Badri, namely Dhyan Badri, Yog Badri , Bridha Badri and Bhavishya Badri. Finally they came across a spot which was blessed with two fascinating cold and hot springs behind river Alaknanda. They were extremely overjoyed on finding this place and thus they named this place as Badri Vishal, this is how Badrinath came into being.\n\n\n\nPANDAVA\'S ASCENT TO SWARGAROHINI VIA BADRINATH\nIt is also said that the Pandavas of the holy epic Mahabharata climbed via \'Swargarohini, popularly known as the ascent to heaven, and Mana town, north of Badrinath while on their route to heaven.\nChardham Uttarakhand\n\n\n\n     THE ORIGIN OF RIVER ALAKNANDA\nLast but not the least, there is another great legendary tale, which is associated to Badrinath. Legends state that the holiest and curse reliever, river Ganges had granted the request of Bhagiratha, for relieving the humanity from the curse of sufferings and sins. While ascending to earth, the intensity of river Ganges was such that it could have immersed the entire earth under its waters. To release the earth from such unbearable consequences, Lord Shiva bore her onto his tresses and ultimately, the river Ganges got divided into twelve holy rivers and river Alaknanda, which flows past the sacred Badrinath Temple, was one of them.\n\n\n\nWHAT TO SEE IN BADRINATH DHAM?\nTourist Attractions near Badrinath\n\n\n                BADRINATH TEMPLE\nAncient texts hold this abode of Lord Vishnu at a very high esteem, stating - \"there are many spots of pilgrimage in the heaven, earth and the world, but there has been none equal to Badri, nor shall there be.\" At the height of 3,133 meters, it stands proud with its rich past along the banks of Alaknanda River. Regarded as the most important temple of Vishnu, the Badrinath shrine is said to be established by Adi Shankaracharya. \n\nHe found the Saligram idol of Lord Badri immersed in the waters of Alaknanda and installed it in a cave near the Tapt Kund.\nIt was in the 16th century that a Garhwal King got a temple erected to house the statue of the God. The present structure is the result of plenty of restorations the temple has undergone due to damages caused by avalanches and earthquakes. Lord Vishnu can be worshipped in a black stone idol sitting in a meditative pose surrounded by idols of other gods like Nar, Narayana, Narad, Ganesha, Garud and Kuber. In the winter season, the idol of Lord Badri is shifted to Yogadhyan Badri in Pandukeshwar (Chamoli district).\n\n\n\n                         TAPT KUND\nJust below the temple, there is a natural thermal spring which is believed to be infused with therapeutic properties. A dip in the holy and hot waters of the Kund is necessary before a devotee visits the sacred shrine of Badrinath. Near the Tapt Kund also lie five boulders which are, as per mythology, Narad, Narsingh, Varah, Garur and Markanday.\n\n\n                      BRAHMA KAPAL\nIt is a flat platform by the banks of Alaknanda 100 meters north of the temple. Performing propitiating rites for the deceased family members, it is believed, would free them from the vicious circle of life and death.\n\n\n\n                 NEELKANTH PEAK\nKnown as the \'Queen of Garhwal\', Neelkanth Peak, standing with its gigantic height of 6,597 meter (approx.), sets a great background to the Badrinath shrine. Named after Lord Shiva, the splendour of the snow-covered peak gets augmented as it receives the first rays of the Sun at the crack of dawn.\n\n\n\n            MATA MURTI MANDIR\nIt is located 3 km from the Badrinath temple, on the banks of Alaknanda River. Mata Murti temple is believed to be the mother of Nara and Narayan, the twin-brother avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu. It was the relentless prayers of Mata Murti that persuaded Lord Vishnu to take birth from her womb. Every year, in the month of September, pilgrims throng to attend the Mata Murti ka Mela (fair).\n\n\n\n\n                   CHARANPADUKA\nStrewn with boulders and caves, a steep climb of about 3 km from the Badrinath town will take you to Charanpaduka. It is a rock which is believed to be imprinted with the footprints of Lord Vishnu, as he descended on earth from Vaikunth (his heavenly abode).\n\n\n                      SHESHNETRA\nBetween two seasonal lakes, on the opposite bank of Alaknanda, there exists a big rock which gives the impression of Shesh Nag, the legendary snake of Lord Vishnu. The Sheshnetra has a natural mark which looks like an eye of the Shesh Nag. Located 1.5 km from the temple, the serpent is believed to be guarding the sacred shrine of Badrinath.\n\n\n\n                      VASUDHARA FALLS\nA 122 meters high beautiful waterfall positioned in the tranquil surroundings of Himalayas can be reached by covering 3 km (up to Mana village) by road and trekking the other 6 km on foot.\n\n HOW TO REACH BADRINATH DHAM?\nROUTE\nHaridwar - Rishikesh - Deoprayag - Kirtinagar - Shrinagar - Rudraprayag - Gauchar - Karnaprayag - Nandprayag - Chamoli - Birahi - Pipalkoti - Garur Ganga - Helang - Joshimath - Vishnuprayag - Govindghat - Pandukeshwar - Hanumanchatti - Badrinath.\nBadrinath by Air\nBY AIR:\nJolly Grant airport, Rishikesh Road, Dehradun, is the nearest airport to Gangotri.

It takes you through a diverse terrain including high altitude passes, moraines, terrifying cliffs, and roaring streams. This trek borders on a Himalayan expedition granted the semi-technical mountaineering techniques that are required. The most alluring lore that veiled the trek was that in ancient times, priests and sages could cover the trek from Badrinath to Kedarnath in just a day!\nOne of the most challenging treks in Uttarakhand, the Panpatia Glacier trek puts your stamina and determination to test. The trail of the Panpatia Glacier trek originates from Badrinath, landing eventually at Nilkanth Khal. It harbours some of the most scenic campsites and meadows perched along the serene banks of glacial lakes. It unfolds a carpet of vibrant floral species that captivate the senses. The view opens to mighty Himalayan behemoths like Nilkantha, Chaukhamba, Nanda Devi, Kunaling, and Balakun.\nCatch breathtaking glimpses of the snout of the actual glacier and Panpatia plateau. This trek is enjoyed best during the summer and autumn months.\nThough the trail is rugged in some sections and laden with loose stones, crevasses and icefalls, no other trek holds a candle to the beauty and the panoramic views of its Himalayan neighbours. Also, walking on an actual glacier is petrifying, no doubt, but is also ten times more exhilarating!

It is very close to the Indo-Chinese border and is surrounded by the Himalayan offshoots on all sides. Yamunotri, lies near the Bandarpunch Mountain, which is 6315 m high and lies to the north. The glacial lake of Saptarishi Kund, on the Kalind Parbat, at an altitude of 4421 m, is the real source of the Yamuna River. Yamunotri is at a distance of 278 km from Dehradun, 236 km from Rishikesh, 176 km from Chamba, and 21 km from Sanya Chatti. It remains cool even during summers. The winters are snow-bound and temperatures fall below 0°C. One is advised to carry light or heavy woolens depending on the time of visit. Best season to visit is May-June and September-October.\nYamunotri, the source of the river Yamuna, is the western most shrine in the Garhwal Himalayas, located on a flank of the Bandarpunch peak (the revered shrine of Yamunotri, source of the shadow of the 6,315 mts high Bandarpunch mountain). It constitutes one of the four most important pilgrimages, collectively called \'char dham\' of the Garhwal Himalayas.','event_pics/1589343095888.png','Overview','Just like Gangotri (the place where the river Ganges originates) Yamunotri is the place where the river Yamuna originates. This pilgrim centre is in the Uttarkashi region at a height of 3233 mts above sea level on the western side of the Banderpoonch peak which is at a height of 6316 mts above sea level. The last bus stop is Hanuman Chatti which is 14 kms away by foot.\nThe actual source of river Yamuna lies a further one km. ahead of Yamunotri, at an altitude of 4,421 m, and the trek to this place is extremely difficult, so pilgrims usually offer obeisance at the Yamunotri temple itself. Legend has it that a sage, Asit Muni, used to reside at this secluded spot in ancient times. The chief attraction at Yamunotri is the temple devoted to goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal springs at Jankichatti (7 km. away). This ancient temple was made by the King of Tehri, Pratap Shah in 1919. It is said that the temple of Yamunotri was built by Maharani Gularia of Jaipur in the last decade of the 19th century. In 1923 this was destroyed, with only the idols left, and was rebuilt. It was once again damaged in 1982. A hot water pool at Yamunotri is used for the preparation of \"PRASAD\" normally rice and potatoes, cooked by dipping them in the hot water, tied in cloth bags.\nDuring winters this place is buried under a heavy blanket of snow, so the approach is extremely difficult. The track along the river bank is quite magnificent, dominated by a wide panorama of mountains. The whole trek to the temple passes through many large and small rivers, lakes, canals, forests, waterfalls, villages and meadows.\nFor reaching Yamunotri, one has to undertake a 220 km journey from Rishikesh to Hanumanchatti, where the motorable road ends. The remaining 13 km journey has to be covered on foot or on ponies.\nThe temple remains closed during the winter months of Nov. to April.\nYamunotri is famous for its trekking routes. The trek route from Hanuman Chatti to Yamunotri is 14 km and takes about 5 hours. It is a picturesque route through the countryside following the river track.\nThe Dodi Tal track, which links Gangotri and Yamunotri, is a famous trek route. It starts from Kalyani, en route Gangotri from Uttar Kashi. It then goes on to Agoda, Dodi Tal (3024 m), Darwa Top (4130 m), Shima and finally Hanuman Chatti. The entire route is about 60 km long and takes about four days to complete.\nThere is another trek from Hanuman Chatti to Phul Chatti and from Janki Chatti to Kharsali.\nBoth routes, from Rishikesh or Dehra Dun converge at Barkot, a place of great scenic beauty, with apple orchards all around and the great Himalaya range forming the skyline.

It is believed that wife of Lord Lakshman cried and prayed a lot for the life of her husband, which insisted Shri Hanuman to bring Sanjivani Butti – the revitalizing herb. When Shri Lakshman regained his health and hail, Gods showered flowers from heaven. Those blossoms formed the roots for the valley of flowers.\n\nAnother mythological belief comes from the ‘Bachittar Natak’, a brief autobiography of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Guru Gobind Singh Ji was the tenth Sikh Guru, who is believed to dwell at Hemkund in his earlier life. In the autobiography of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, he mentioned about his earlier incarnation as sage Dusht-Daman and his stay at the Lokpal Lake. As per the belief, the great sage Dusht-Daman meditated for long years and then submerged in God. The place and the Gurudwara were unrevealed until the 20th century.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh Ji also mentioned that the King Pandu (the father of Pandavas) practiced yoga amidst the seven peaks surrounding the Hemkund. Thus, this is yet another legendary tale associated with Shri Hemkund Sahib Ji Yatra.','event_pics/IMG_20200519_152230.JPG','Hemkund Sahib Ji Gurudwara','Hemkund Sahib Ji Gurudwara\nSurrounded by seven beautiful peaks, Hemkund Sahib Ji gifts both tranquility and spiritual enlightenment to the pilgrims.

This would build the self confidence in an individual to \nhandle life challenges in a more effective manner.\nFollowing are the some soft skills:-','event_pics/20200906_192136.jpg','1. UNDERSTANDING ONESELF ','One of the major issues that a person faces when reaching his/her life goals is, not having \nunderstood who he/she is. This lack of understanding is the cause behind the inability to solve problems efficiently or to logically reach a conclusion after assessing the pros and cons of a problem.\n\nTherefore this topic will create an opportunity to identify a person’s skills, aspirations, qualities and personality traits.\n\n\n2. PROBLEM MANANGEMENT\n\nFacing problems are part and parcel of our daily life. But there are instances where people have attempted suicide due to their inability to handle problems successfully. Therefore it has become vital to learn the skill of problem management as a soft skill.\n\n','event_pics/harvest-ideas-what-is-innovation-1.jpg','3. INNOVATIVE THINKING ','In order to successfully overcome life\'s challenges and obstacles, one should free himself of the traditional ways of thinking and adopt a new and creative way of thinking. Employing such novel methods would help a person to reach ones goals in a unique manner with minimum effort. To enhance creativity while departing from traditional thinking, some activities can be done.\n\n4. LEADERSHIP\n\nLet us understand the concepts about leadership. A leader can be identified as a person who motivates and guides the people who are striving to achieve a common goal in the family, society or workplace.\nThe unfortunate situation of today is that most people are waiting for a person to guide them because they have failed to identify the leadership qualities within him/ her. Even if one gets the leadership opportunity it is more challenging to maintain it. Therefore leadership is a soft skill that needs to be developed.\n','event_pics/20200906_192035.jpg','5. STRESS AND EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT','    \n\n\n Two of the major causes behind stress are a person’s work environment and the complex social background. Also there is a direct link between time management and stress management. Over work, i.e. the work that cannot be completed within the work hours and work that exceeds your capability directly affects your stress levels.\nHowever there’s also a positive outlook on stress called “required stress”. An example is the stress induced by fear of an exam which could motivate a person to study.     Management of emotions such as anger, sorrow, and happiness has a direct relationship with the management of stress. Relaxed and free mind will distance you from anger. Managing ones emotions to prevent harmfully affecting oneself or others is a quality of a great personality.\nManagement of emotions is not the same as not expressing the emotions. There should be freedom to cry when sad, to smile or laugh when one is happy. Managing your emotions, will keep you you at ease.\n\n','2020-09-06 14:22:07.094698'),(92,'Current_situation','none','Air pollution','event_pics/images_92.jpeg','Air pollution in India','Air pollution in India is a serious health issue.\nOf the most polluted cities in the world, 21 out of 30 were in India in 2019.\nAs per a study based on 2016 data, at least 140 million people in India breathe air that is 10 times or more over the WHO safe limit and 13 of the world\'s 20 cities with the highest annual levels of air pollution are in India','event_pics/images_87.jpeg','Air pollution contributes','Air pollution contributes to the premature deaths of 2 million Indians every year.

Around the glacier, one can also view the peaks of Gangotri Group - Shivling, Thalay Sagar, Meru, and Bhagirathi III.\n\n----------About gomukh -----\n\n\n\nGomukhi\" Assamese  is the terminus or pout of the Gangotri Glacier and the source of the Bhagirathi River, one of the primary headstreams of the Ganges River. \nThe place is situated at a height of 13,200 ft (4,023 m) in Uttarkashi district in the state of Uttarakhand, India.\n\n It is one of the largest in the Himalayas with an estimated volume of over 27 cubic kilometers. \n\nIt is a popular Hindu pilgrimage site, along with Gangotri, as well as trekking destination\n\n\n\nThe most well known tapovan in India is the area above the Gangotri Glacier at one of the primary sources of the Ganges, in Uttarakhand, India. \n\nAt the foot of Shivling peak, a barren area at about 4,463m (14640 feet) elevation, is a seasonal home to several sadhus living in caves, huts etc. and it has become a trekking destination also.\n\nThe trekking usually starts from Gomukh and the trek was considered moderate to difficult \n\n\n---About tapovan -----\n\nTapovan (Sanskrit) comes from the two root words tapas - meaning penance and by extension religious mortification and austerity, and more generally spiritual practice, and vana, meaning forest or thicket. Tapovan then translates as forest of austerities or spiritual practice.\n\nSome important fact \n\n\nIn Honour to the great saint Tapovan Maharaj this area was named as Tapovan. He authored two books on his travels through the Himalayas: \"Wanderings in the Himalayas\" (Himagiri Viharam) and \"Kailasa Yatra.\" Tapovan Maharaj exhibited a deep love for nature and his accounts of his travels demonstrate such.[citation needed] His autobiography, written in Sanskrit is titled \"Ishvara Darshana\". After observance of rites and rituals following the Master\'s last earthly breath (1957), Shri Swami Tapovan Maharaj\'s body was interred into the holy Ganga by a procession of Sadhus. To this present day, there is a simple, solemn and dignified way in which the Uttarkashi monks mark the samaadhi of any sadhu and Swami Tapovan Maharaj represents the ideal of austerity and pinnacle of wisdom which all anchorites aspire to.\nAbout the Destination:\n\nGomukh Tapovan Trek is considered as one of the most exciting and thrilling treks. Resembling the mouth of a cow, the Gomukh Glacier is one of the main water sources of the holy Ganges. \nAround the glacier, one can also view the peaks of Gangotri Group - Shivling, Thalay Sagar, Meru, and Bhagirathi III. \nIn addition to its mesmerising beauty and appeal, it is also an important pilgrimage site for the Hindus and a dip in its water is considered as a sacred ritual.\nOn the other hand, Tapovan is located at the foothills of the Shivling Peak and is considered as a challenging route for the trekkers. \n\nReaching a height of around 14,640ft, it is often thronged by the sadhus. This thrilling Gomukh Tapovan Trek takes you through some of the untouched places of the region. Marvel at the sight of the amazing beauty of the region as you keep continuing your trek. The sight of the Bhagirathi sisters glistening in the moonlight from Bhojbasa will make you stare at it for long.\n\nThe trekking trail typically has steady inclines and level walks. Trek for another 20-30 minutes and you will see another stream gushing below a makeshift bridge. You get clear perspectives of the Bhagirathi crests from Chirbasa.

After morning aarti in Kalpeshwar start the trek to Dumak. After crossing the village the trail goes through beautiful terrace fields and a couple of shepherd huts.\n\nThe altitude gradually increases as you climb up the trail but there is no steep climb involved. After trekking for 3 hours, you’ll reach a pass which will open up the view of other side of the valley. The trail will be followed with sharp descent there on. Rest for a while in a village you come across then trek further down to the bridge. As soon as you cross the bridge, you’ll see a temple.\n\n\n Dumak is another 1hour away from this place.

Mt. Annapurna (8091m) of Nepal is the 10th highest mountain in the world and the journey to its base camp, which is at 4130m/13549ft height, is one of the most popular walks on earth. Moreover, we reach our destination via Mt. Machapuchhre (Fishtail) which is revered by the Nepalese for its unique beauty. Furthermore, thanks to the well-groomed itinerary of the Annapurna Base Camp trekking package, it is a popular choice among diverse outdoor enthusiasts, from a solo female traveler to hikers travelling in groups to Nepal.\n\nOur Annapurna Base Camp Trek has a short, 11-day itinerary compared to most walks in this region leading up to the base camp. The particular route is designed for globetrotters who wish to hike to the base camp of the spectacular mountain but are restricted time-wise.

In Hinduism Mount Meru is considered to be the Centre of all the physical, metaphysical and spiritual universes. In addition to that, some believe that Meru Peak was named after this sacred mountain. On the other hand, others explain that the name \"Meru\" originated from Sanskrit word for spine, attributing to the shape of the mountain.\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the mountain has three peaks: southern the highest - 6,660 m (21,850 ft), central - 6,310 m (20,700 ft), and northern - 6,450 m (21,160 ft). The two higher peaks were climbed earlier than the more challenging central peak, which was first climbed in 2001 by Valery Babanov.\n\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that the central peak is the lowest of the three, it is the most famous as it has one of the most complicated routes in the world - the Shark\'s Fin.

Ascending through the large gray steps leading to the holy sanctums we find inscriptions in Pali on the steps. The present temple was built by Adi Shankaracharya. The inner walls of the temple sanctum are adorned with figures of various deities and scenes from mythology. According to legends, the Pandavas sought the blessings of lord Shiva to atone their sin after the battle of Mahabharata. Lord Shiva eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull. On being followed, he dived into ground leaving behind his hump on the surface. Outside the temple door a large statue of the Nandi Bull stands as guard.. It is at this time, that the doors of the temple are thrown open to pilgrims, who flock from all parts of India, for a holy pilgrimage.\nKedarnath is amongst the holiest pilgrimages for the devout Hindu. It is set amidst the stunning mountainscape of the Garhwal Himalayas at the head of the Mandakini River. Kedar is another name of lord Shiva, the protector and the destroyer. The shrine of Kedarnath is very scenically placed, and is surrounded by lofty, snow – covered mountains, and during summer grassy meadows covering the valleys. Immediately behind the temple, is the high Keadardome peak, which can be sighted from great distances.

In the local dialect, Black Peak means “Kalanag” since the top part of the peak resembles a Black Cobra. It is the most dominating peak of the entire Bandarpunch massif. Providing a gradual climb from the Southern side eventually leading to a very steep summit climb with a near 70-degree incline and a 75 feet ice wall, the climb to the summit of Black Peak is challenging and technical. It is only chosen by professional climbers for an adventure of a lifetime. Black peak is located in the Govind National Park area known for its diverse flora and fauna. The trail leading to the mountain is blessed with magnificent alpine meadows, pine forests, moraine ridges, boulders, and glacier basins. Being the highest peak in the range amongst Saraswati Devi Parvat (Bandarpunch I, 6316 m) and Hanuman Parvat (White Peak or Bandarpunch II, 6102 m), to reach the zenith of the Black Peak will take a lot of effort and experience testing your limits but rewarding you with unparalleled views of the full Bandarpunch family, a milestone for any aspiring trekker and mountaineer.\nKalang/ Black

Now the risky moment was we had to trek downwards from the cliff and due to  snowfall we were facing difficulties somehow we managed to reach our 1st milestone and it was Bhramtaal......we stayed there for about an hour or 2 after that we decided to cover Bekaltaal from Bhramtaal. It was around 8 to 10 km trek. As we started our trek to Bekaltaal the rainfall started again again but with a twist. Now the snow turn was over it was the hails. When the hail started to fall it was very small in size and no sooner it turned into hail storm and the size of the hail was like a medium size potato  and there were no camps or tree nearby so we continued the trek and was hitting by the hails  after 3 4 hours we reached bekaltaal. As soon as we reach there the snow started falling but within 1 hour there was sun shining bright. We did not expected this much twist and turns of whether on the same day. Nearabout 6 in the evening we reached our destination Lohajung was very tired but the trek was worth.Has experienced lot many things for the first time. If you are adventurous then I would suggest you to follow the trek path we chose. And I can say that you will not regret your decision.

After that we continued our journey, in our route many villages we crossed & in one of the villages named Gondar, we met a little bhotiya puppy(Himalayan breed) who was newly borned. When it was afternoon, we all were tired. Kabir again motivated me and arranged a stick for me and asked to take lead. And that was the journey within, I spent time with myself and mother nature, I took some shots from my Camera. My back was aching due to the weight of my bagpack, but all those sceneries were filling my heart with warmth.

Actually I was not ready for the trip, but kabir forced me and I made my mind to go for the trip. And today I really appreciate my decision. Early in the morning we started our trip. We went to srinagar, there we met Amit Bhai, who is cool and calm, without whom the trip wouldn\'t have been completed. He played a major role in our journey. In srinagar we bought some stuff for the journey . Then we three (me, deepak, Amit Bhai) went to rudraprayag from srinagar. We reached there nearly at 5:00pm. There we bought a camera and went to Ransi on the same day. There we had homemade dinner which was quiet delicious. Upto Ransi we travelled by transport. The real trekking begins from Ransi. On next day we started for Madyamaheshwar Mandir. On the way we enjoyed nature\'s beauty which was amazing. On our way we had our lunch. We reached Madyamaheshwar Mandir nearly at 8:30 pm. We were all wet because weather was not in our favour. Rainwater got seep in our bag and our bags became very heavy. There we stayed in the village. Next day we went for budha Madyamaheshwar which was on the top of the village and from there we saw chaukhamba parvat. That day also weather was not good so we stayed there. The next day we started for Nandikund. Actually the trek is really tough and one should be mentally prepared for any kind of weather conditions. On that day we reached to kanchnidhar and stayed there in tent. It was the nice experience to sleep inside sleeping bag inside the tent. We cooked khichdi. On the next day we started for pandav Sera. We reached pandav sera nearly between 4-5 pm. There we stayed in tent, and there we ate oats. On the next day we begin for Nandikund. On the way, there is a river which need to be crossed. Actually this part (pandav sera to Nandikund) of the trek was the toughest part of the journey. When we reached Nandikund, we were amazed to see the nature\'s beauty. Our plan was to reach Bansinarayan, but we were not sure of the way, so we moved back to Pandav sera and stayed there. The next day we travelled back to Madyamaheshwar. And on the next day we reached to Srinagar. We stayed in gurudwara in Srinagar. The next day Amit Bhai went to his relatives house and me deepak went to college.','trekker_story_pics/IMG_20201221_202332.JPG','trekker_story_pics/IMG_20201221_202213.JPG','approved','4','Nandikund','2020-12-21 14:53:45.945385'),(32,'Naina ','Not all those who wander are lost!!
